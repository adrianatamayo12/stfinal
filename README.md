# stfinal
My replication package for my STA215 final. For this project, me and my group watched random episodes of the hit Netflix series “Stranger Things” to assess whether certain aspects of a scene seem to have an impact or influence on a different aspect within the same scene. We looked at things like emotional tone, visual effects, audio effects, plot, and romance.

# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA215-KALINOWSKI.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "UPDATED FINAL PROJ DATASET - Sheet1 (2).csv" file.

# Data
All of the data seen above was taken from random episodes of Stranger Things across all 4 seasons.  To gather this information, my group mates and I watched the episodes and checked to see if each scene had any, for example, presence of blood or crying and if it did, we would mark down a 1 for yes or a 0 for no. What I am looking for as I compare these variables if they have an impact on whether a character is crying or vice versa.
